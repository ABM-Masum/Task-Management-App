# Basic Custom Framework
This PHP project is a basic usable own little custom framework similar to Laravel. That is why there is nothing interesting in the browser level view sections
but all the hard work is in the code base. These are the works a FRAMEWORK easily handles behind the scenes. Almost all the codes in this project is hand written, 
nothing is imported except the composer vendor directory for autoloading classes.
